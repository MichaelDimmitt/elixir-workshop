# Slides

The slides are written in markdown format in one file per section named
`slides.md`. If markdown isn't your thing and you want to see them as originally
presented in the browser you need to do the following:

1. Install Ruby
2. Install Ruby's bundler
3. Run `bundle install`
4. Run `reveal-ck generate`
5. Run `reveal-ck serve`

One day I may change this to run statically or host it.
